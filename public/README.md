# Test Audio Files

For the listening practice feature to work, you need to:

1. Add a test audio file named `test-beep.mp3` in this directory
2. The file should be a short audio clip (1-2 seconds) for testing
3. You can use any audio file in MP3 format

Example sources for test audio:
- Record a simple sound using a microphone
- Use a text-to-speech service to generate an MP3
- Use a royalty-free sound effect

The audio player is configured to look for `/test-beep.mp3` at the root of the public directory.
